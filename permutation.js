 /*
 Question: given a string, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.
 Permutation: It means the strings are the same and  the characters are in the same exact positions.

 algorithm:
 - check if they are the same exact strings
 - check length of both strings
 - create an object of each one
 - check if the objects character count are equal
 - return true  
 */

 const isPermutation = (str1, str2)=>{
    // check if they are the same exact strings
    if(str1===str2){
        return true;
    }
    if
